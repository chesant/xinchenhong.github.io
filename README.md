## News
- 2020.6.13    I get a PhD dgree in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University(FAFU).
- 2020.8.30    I finish my cooperation research in University of British Columbia.


## Research interests
Urban soundscape, urban forest acoustics, urban greening and their applications, particularly in:
- Soundscape in urban forests
